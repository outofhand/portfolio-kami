## Explanation

Reddit Viewer is a responsive Reddit image viewer application utilizing the Reddit API.

## Problem

Most Reddit image viewers show thumbnail images on subreddit lists. This makes it difficult or impossible to see the details of the image to determine if you want to view the post or comments. If you view the post or comments, you are taken to another page, requiring you to return to the original subreddit list page. 

## Solution

Reddit Viewer shows full size or moderately scaled images in the original list view allowing you to clearly see what the post is about. The posts are added dynamically as you scroll down the page. If you wish to view the comments, they are shown on a slide-out panel so that you do not have to leave the original list page allowing you to quickly navigate between commenst and posts.

## Results

Reddit Viewer is streamlined and lightweight limiting the amount of page refreshes when looking through Reddit posts and comments. The application is responsive so it looks great on any device size. Reddit Viewer comes with an assortment of popular image subreddits but also allows you to edit and add subreddits. 

> Reddit Viewer is the perfect application for viewing image subreddits on any device. 

## Conclusion

Reddit Viewer allows you to quickly and easily look through any image subreddit post and comments.

## Explanation

Blocitoff is a self-destructing todo list application built using AngularJS and Firebase.

## Problem

There are any number of todo list applications to choose from but they all suffer from a common problem which is clutter. As you add tasks, it is too easy to get lost in the mess of which tasks are important and which tasks should be removed at a certain time.

## Solution

Blocitoff helps you stay on top of tasks by allowing you to set a deadline. When the deadline is reached, the task turns red as a notification that it is about to go dormant. When the due date expires, the task is marked as dormant and removed from the active task list. 

## Results

By utilizing due dates, Blocitoff acts as your personal task assistant. If a task due date expires, that task is removed from the active task list allowing you to focus on any remaining tasks.

## Conclusion

Blocitoff is designed as a full-featured todo list application with the additional feature to manage overdue tasks.
